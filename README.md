# My Portfolio website

Intending to create a web application-like portfolio website that comes with Next.js and Prisma
   
  
## TODO
  
- styled-jsx doesn't apply to Material-UI-Icons since Material-UI-Icons doesn't use its styling as pure css className. However, using styled-components instead arises client-side rendering of UI components.  

## Run on dev mode
  
1. Clone project    

```
git clone https://github.com/benawad/fullstack-graphql-airbnb-clone.git
```
  
2. Install dependencies  

```
npm install
```
2. Run    

```
npm run dev
```
